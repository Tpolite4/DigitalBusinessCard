      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m a passionate engineering professional with experience collaborating
        with Fortune 500 companies across multiple industries, leading
        cross-functional teams, and delivering impactful solutions. Currently
        diving deep into full-stack development, I bring a unique perspective
        shaped by my diverse background. As a Software Engineer, I thrive on
        solving complex technical challenges with a mix of analytical thinking
        and creativity. I am currently working with technologies such as Svelte
        and TypeScript, on Svelvet, an open source product focused on building
        dynamic node-interfaces and diagrams. Beyond Svelvet, I am skilled in
        JavaScript, Node.js, React, TailwindCSS, and SQL. Iâ€™m always eager to
        explore new technologies, build scalable solutions, and collaborate on
        exciting projects. ðŸ’¡ Letâ€™s connect! If youâ€™re interested in working
        together, feel free to reach out. You can also find me on GitHub
        @Tpolite4.
